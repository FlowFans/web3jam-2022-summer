This is a socially simulating game aim at driving web3 to carbon zero.    
    
There is an huge obstacle for Blockchain and WEB3 promotion: environmental problems.  Who started the trouble should end it, it is worth exploring how to solve the environmental problems of web3 with web3 solutions.     
      
This game hopes to motivate individuals/communities to participate in low-carbon life and donate trees to offset the carbon emissions they generated on web3.    
    
This project builds an protocol to record every account's carbon emissions on blockchain according to their gas consume. <br>

This project builds a web3-game based on the CarbonEmission protocol. In this game:<br>
1) You can live a carbon zero life to earn carbon energy(CET) <br>
2) You can also donate or adopt tree NFTs for free, your donation will contribute to reforest the Spain Alcoroches Natural Park or Australian National Park suffered from forest fire<br>
3) You can make wishes on your donated tree NFT, the wishes will be permanently stored on the blockchain<br>
4) You can burn your carbon energy(CET) to water for your own trees or your friend's trees, watering can make the trees grow bigger and more beautiful<br>
5) Your friends can turn your carbon emissions to a bomb in a limited time and fire it to attack your trees, the bomb will wither your tree <br>
6) You can restore the health of your wilted tree by burnning your carbon energy(CET) to water it<br>

This game can be played not only among friends, but also within the community. Once a tree NFT is transferred to a community-run smart contract, community members can fire bombs and water the tree. The lower the carbon emission of the smart contract, the healthier the tree will be; and the more eco-friendly the community members are, the bigger the tree will grow.<br><br>
