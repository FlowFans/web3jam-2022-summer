## Description

The voiceprint NFT implements the style transformation for voice, which can converse male voices to female voices, or ordinary vocal content into celebrity voices. We will provide a rich target sound library, while the sound in the library will be mint as a voiceprint NFT, voiceprint NFT holders can arbitrarily choose their own desired timbre for voice conversion,to show their personality and characteristics in the Mataverse. In the early stage, we will provide Chinese and English voice conversion, and further provide small language conversion to meet the needs of users around the world, while providing celebrity voiceprint NFTs, we will also provide voiceprint NFTs of non-human characters in famous film and television dramas, such as  Gollum in "The Lord of the Rings", Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and Sonic in "Transformers". In the future, users will also be allowed to upload their own voice to make a voiceprint NFT to mint their own voiceprint NFT works, and earn value by selling or renting. The product we provide is not only a voiceprint conversion tool, but also a comprehensive platform that will mining users' voice talent, creativity and self-presentation. The users can not only use it as an external expression form of their own metaverse, but also become the creators of sounds in the metaverse. Voiceprint NFT contains  vivid timbre, rich emotions, and makes it possible to express all this intuitively. Then the users can be heard and felt by the whole world.

### Problem statement

Currently, the intelligent Voice metaverse in Web3 have big problems:

- Privacy: Using one's own voice in Web3 social networking will cause privacy leakage and destroy the properties of the Metaverse's freedom and security
- Emotion: Existing voice services are seriously lacking in mechanical sense and emotionless, destroying the immersive experience of the Metaverse
- Communicate: Although the main source of information for humans comes from sight, speech is the best way to socialize
- Cost: In the existing animation, game, and virtual idol scenes, it is still necessary to invite many voice actors to dub the characters, and the cost is huge

Univoice can support indivisual needs for Web3.0 metaverse
- Users with personalized needs for voice in the metaverse
- NFT enthusiasts
- Metaverse socialization

Besides, we can also support a business-to-business service in different domains, such as 
- Virtual idol interaction
- Social contact transformation
- Animation dubbing
- GameFi NPC interaction








### Proposed solution

We've developed a novel mode, Univoice, for voice with Flow & NLP algorithms in AI. With our Dapp, web3ers can firstly extract their voiceprints to mint the one and only NFT, Voice Print NFT (VP-NFT). Then, web3ers can fulfill themselves with their own voice and make a transection with other's voice. Finally, they can converse their voices freely and uniquely. 

Besides, our Dapp can also support a business-to-business service in different domains, such as 

- Virtual idol interaction
- Social contact transformation
- Animation dubbing
- GameFi NPC interaction
