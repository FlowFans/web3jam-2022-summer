## Description

SoulMade is dedicated to **build a composable NFT platform**, to be the bottom layer of the meta-universe, to provide anyone with a fairly rich NFT configuration.  

### Problem statement

NFT is rapidly emerging in 2021, with transactions totaling more than $40 billion. This growth can be attributed to the growing demand for digital artwork. **But the combinable nature of digital artwork is far underestimated and undervalued**. The appeal of combinable NFT is in the versatility, for example: `clothing in the meta-universe, a single NFT certainly can not meet the needs of changing; mechanical products power/battery, if you can not replace the battery or upgrade the device, it loses 90% of its meaning; weapons and equipment decoration/gems/card slot... `. These are the future of composability NFT.

**SoulMade aspires to be the first combinable NFT platform on Flow** and we are not just serving the photo platform, we are serving the music design, and we are aiming at the metaverse. With the metaverse as a reality, anyone will need a combinable, stitchable exhibit to showcase their charms in different angles and to fulfill their desires.

`Everyone can unleash their creativity here, a platform owned by artists, creators and collectors.` As an artist creating original digital artwork, you can sell your unique designs in 2D and 3D art, music or video through direct sales. As a creator, you can also explore artwork in your own way and recreate it as your own art project. As a collector, you will find different art displays and secondary creations from artists and creators around the world and buy and sell them on our marketplace.

2D images will be our starting point, and more media formats will be added to the process. **We believe that everyone has a creative mind and that you can make it valuable and profitable.**

- **Target audience**:  **All people who identify the metaverse as the future**.
- **Evidence for the need:**  **Composability NFT is the basis of the metaverse.**
