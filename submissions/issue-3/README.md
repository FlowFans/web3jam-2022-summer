## Description

### Problem statement
- **For most of the Web2 products which planned to migrate to Web3, it's hard to integrate blockchain wallet addresses into the existing account system in a C/S architecture product without sacrificing the UX.**  
[ORCAMOBI](http://www.orcamobi.com/), one of our collaborators with around 50M user basis worldwide, is looking for a solution that seamlessly integrate user's blockchain address with their existing accounts system.

- **In most scenarios, we can only decide whether buy or not by an NFT's price, appearance and maybe perks. There are fewer ways to develop a deeper bond with the collections.**  
There're too many NFT projects(especially PFP genre) has few utilities except being used as a profile picture. The potentialities are out there to be developed.  
Projects such as Fabricant, Loots, and Some.place are providing objects in the metaverse. However, the owner of these objects should have the power to re-utilise them.

- **Most NFT collections lack practical use cases, and holders cannot be a part of the creation process or offer their talents to the projects.**  
Nowadays, few projects involve holders as builders during the creation. Even for the projects that support customisation(e.g. Flovatar and MetaSoul), an owner of NFTs is still limited to the preset options provided by the project teams.  
The thresholds for being a creator/builder are still very high for most participants, either for the creating skills or coding abilities. Moreover, growing audiences from zero to one is also a pain point for the creators.

Renas is a gamified co-creation platform for evolving Web3 IPs, incubated by THiNG.FUND. By using Renas, every NFT holder could utilize their own collections and create stories together with their friends. Besides, they could get token incentives by playing, creating and participating in the governance.
- To the **players**, it’s a classic game, but they govern it;
- To the **creators**, it’s an IP generator that anyone can be a part of the co-creation and earn both reputation and incentives;
- To the **traders and collectors**, it’s easier to discover the actual value of an asset by simply following the trends in the community.

#### Sign-up with your most familiar social account
Renas allows users to log in via their social account(Discord account has already connected at the current stage), and it will automatically map a user's wallet address by querying data via **Emerald Id**. A Web2 account system can easily integrate it with the method by adding a simple mapping table and using the service of Emerald Id and other existing on-chain services.


#### To create is as easy as playing a game
The contents in Renas are generated by official and users. The primary concept is about character evolving, base construction and adventure. You can recruit multiple characters and send them out on adventures. They will loot better equipment and resources. However, you may risk losing the equipment if they fail on adventures.

Every action you perform, every decision you make, and every interaction you have with other characters, will be automatically recorded and appended as part of the Metadata of the NFT. It will help you grow stronger emotional bonds with your characters.

#### Creator's economy and governance model
For advanced users, they can become creators. Their creations will appear in the game, they can earn profit shares from other players, and we also designed an incentive program for popular creations.

Regarding the governance right, for example, if someone proposed a revision to existing content, stakeholders(e.g. NFT holders and FT stakers) can vote on it. If the revision succeeds the vote, it will merge with the original one. If it fails, it will fork as an individual one. So even if a proposal fails to win majority support, its creator will still be recognised  by some of the community. This actually shows respect for the efforts and provides positive feedback for the creators. By using this mechanism, the content amount will increase, and there’ll be more potential content for speculators to stake on, and poor content will fade out, only the ones that are useful to the players will remain in the sights.

## What was done during Web3 Jam
The features of Renas we finished during Web3 Jam are:


- **Easily signing up and mapping with wallet**  
In Renas, users can sign up via their familiar Web2 auth methods, e.g. Discord. Once logged in, Renas will automatically query Emerald Id to see if there's their Discord<>wallet address mapping data. If so, Renas will create a record for mapping the account with the wallet address. The user would not even notice that until they need to verify their assets in the wallet or withdrawal.

- **Topping up as easy as using mainstream platforms**  
Once a user needs to top up their tokens, they will be redirected to a service page, then connect their wallet and approve the transaction.  
Renas will monitor the transaction status and automatically update a user's balance in game.

- **Withdrawing within one click**
In most circumstance, users don't need to handle any onchain activities. They only care about the assets they withdrawed from the game and the time they about to receive. In Renas, all they need to do is clicking the withdraw button and checking if the transaction is completed later.

- **Switchable soulbound fungible tokens**
In some scenarios, such as being at the early stage of MVP or purely measuring contribution during the user's lifespan, the fungible tokens should be set to soul-bounded. Once a project goes to the mass market, the same fungible tokens might need to be able to switch to transferrable.  
Renas' token contract provides the method to turn on/off the transferring so that a project could be customised to fit the needs.

- **Governed by holding both fungible tokens & NFTs**
A user can vote for the proposals in Renas, such as a revision of an individual gaming item, a global variable change, or a new content submission. To do that, the user should stake the governance tokens and specific NFTs in Renas to gain the voting weight.
