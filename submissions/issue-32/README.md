## Description

​	The number plate (racenumber) worn by participants in large marathons, cycling and other mass sporting events is an essential element.

​	The Racenumber NFT system is called "meta-number NFT" by designing the number plate as an abstract NFT of domain name type similar to ENS. The holder of a "racenumber NFT" has the right to Mint NFTs of various themes (e.g. Tokyo Marathon theme) and sell them for their own use or for others to use.
The NFT is tied to the runner's behavior, which is stored as JSON on the IPFS/Arweave network.

​	All in all, Racenumber takes NFT of number plates as the core, empowers the real industry, connects the data on and off the chain, and reconstructs the whole large-scale race organization and management system, and is also an innovative practice of combining abstract NFT paradigm and traditional NFT.

### Problem statement

- Traditional sports competition number plate One-time use with untapped in-depth value that cannot be added to the brand.
- Organizers of popular sports events An attempt to combine traditional tournaments with Web3 to empower traditional industries while expanding the user base of Web3 Players.
- Traditional competition data Data is stored centrally, there is a risk of loss, and it is difficult to connect data between different applications.

### Proposed solution

- Product Introduction
  - abstract number plate NFT -- a race organizer may issue its own set of number plates, which may be used across different races of that race organizer.
  - Theme Number Plate NFT -- a race organizer issues a theme number plate NFT based on the specific race at hand, and a Hodler holding an abstract number plate NFT has the right to Mint a theme number plate NFT.
  - 3D Number Plate Entities -- Hodlers with Theme Number Plates NFTs may apply to a 3D Printer service provider to have the number plates printed as physical NFTs for participation in the race.
  - Domain Name System -- In cooperation with various decentralized domain name projectors (e.g. .fn, .bit, .pns), organizers can Mint their own decentralized domain names, bind their own addresses and home pages, and issue second-level domain names to their own users.
