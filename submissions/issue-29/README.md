## Description

OVERLU NFT is a dynamic upgradeable NFT equity asset. Owners can customize their unique appearances, meanwhile, unlock the corresponding premium utilities when upgrading components or inserting different types of DNA into Models. Owners may upgrade a single component several times, or diversify NFT assets and utilities by combining them with several enhanced components.

Package：
Each exquisitely designed Package of OVERLU is an NFT. Once the Package is opened, it’s also burned to obtain a Model and an initial DNA, in which rarity, function, and equity are all random.

DNA：
DNA is of significance that carries info and value. It not only records changes in appearance but also is a component and a proof of utility in the real world. There are currently five types of DNA acting on 5 different parts of the Model. Noted that it’s irreversible when initial DNA functions, but when it does, the utility follows.

Model:
It integrates all adaptation components of DNA. Different Models will have different abilities to combine with DNAs, which depend on their basic attributes.
Each Model is given 1 to 3 DNAs to be integrated with. Only if the DNA that injected into the Model, can it produce real utility (upgrade the appearance components and obtain the corresponding rights).

Users are allowed to combine with DNAs of the same attribute multiple times, and the utility that granted after combination will be layered according to the number of DNA used.
The evolution of appearance components will be upgraded according to the new path—that is, the components of the same part will be continuously upgraded, and the utilities given to users increase according to the number of used DNA.
More cool stuff’s awaits.

Surely, the composability of utility changes how people perceive DNFT, and this unique mechanism certainly makes DNFT assets no longer just at the level of visualization. 
OVERLU also grants you essential preference of utility.
