# General Utility Functions

Small single purpose functions.

## What should go in here:

- Small single purpose functions.
- Functions without dependencies.
- Fuctions should ideally be pure and free of side effects.
- Functions that format values.
- Functions that could be pulled out eventually into their own node module (zero deps).

## what shouldn't go in here

- Stateful things.
- Functions with side effects.
