Overview
In this era of rapid information development, individual value is infinitely magnified by the Internet, thus people are increasingly willing to trust information from individuals. Each person can create different information based on his or her unique knowledge, skills and experience. We have witnessed the rise of countless KOL on the internet, verifying the value of individuals by time and the market.
However, with the development of Internet giants, the value of information has been deprived by platforms and the freedom of creation has been restricted again and again. If creators trigger some keywords, such as the name of other platforms, the publicity of their posts will be restricted. Platforms can also easily close an account and delete certain content.
At the same time, platforms have a lot of determination over what the average user can see by often displaying homogenous, inflammatory and disturbing content to attract users.
We are limited by what we can create and read, which is why we created SALIGIA.
SALIGIA aims to create an unrestricted UGC(user-generated content) platform that reinvents digital content creation and consuming behavior. Anyone can enter SALIGIA to create and purchase content in different thematic communities, allowing users to earn tokens "SIN" when creating and browsing content, purchasing paid content, and participating in community management. Community members will act as curators of each content partition to deliver excellent content.
Here, let's break the limits, reclaim the power to create and read, and reshape the value of personal information.
Welcome to the new era of content creation.

Vision & Mission
-  Be free and brave
The word "saligia" is taken from the first letter of the Latin word for each of the seven deadly sins. " Gluttony", "Greed", "Laziness", "Envy", " Pride," "Lust," and "Anger," are the seven evils of man, and we are always admonished to stay away from them. These sins are not a violation of love, but rather a desire to stimulate the nature of love. We innovate out of laziness, we become jealous out of love, and we rise up because of pride. To Enjoy lust, be brave enough to express your anger, and indulge in good food and beautiful things.
Just like the existing creative environment, all people are shackled to suppress their nature. And the restrictions on women are even heavier.
You have to be thin, gentle, hardworking, understated and pure.
That's why we choose the female avatar SIN GIRLS as our Genesis NFT.
Love sins, love the sinner. break these frames that limit our behavior, be true to our nature and free ourselves.

- Value ideas and information
We believe that the information generated by each individual based on their unique knowledge, skills and experience is valuable. And that information value needs a platform to make it visible.
The mobile Internet has indeed amplified the value of personal information, and SALIGIA will reinvent the value of ideas and information. 
SALIGIA is a decentralized UGC platform where users log in through their wallets. The account and the content created belong entirely to the user, and the platform has no right to change or delete the content.
SALIGIA users will truly own their data and earn from it, which includes tokens generated from the creation and consumption of content. At the same time, the members of the community can also benefit from the revenues obtained by the community, such as advertising promotions.

Background
In this part, we will discuss the limitations of the NFT value from two perspectives: the problems of the traditional WEB2 and existing WEB3 UCG platforms, to explain why Saligia stands out. 
Finally, we will also state why we chose the FLOW chain.
- Limitations of NFT value
Users can write their own SIN STORY on NFT, therefore the value of NFT is no longer limited to rarity, as users' creativity will give more value to it.
At the same time, SIN GIRLS has a solid application scenario. It will be used as the membership identity of Saligia platform, bringing more rights and benefits to the owner.

- Traditional WEB2 UGC platform
Traditional WEB2 creation platform has low freedom of creation and the account does not belong to the user.
SALIGIA is a decentralized UGC platform where users log in through their wallets and their accounts and the content they create belongs entirely to them. The content created will be stored on and off the chain. Creators are free to upload their works without being reviewed. And the platform has no right to change or delete the content.

-Existing WEB3 platforms
Now most web3 UGC platforms have WEB3-related content, and the categories are relatively single. So the threshold for ordinary users to become creators is high. Our product uses a partitioning model, so anyone can find their own interest and expertise in the product. The APP is also in line with the traditional WEB2 users' habits. Hoping to bring the users into the web3 world without any perception.
The existing WEB3 authoring platform temporarily lacks the content distribution function.
SALIGIA has three modes of content distribution.
1. The content of each partition on SALIGIA will be curated by community screening, and the content generated by different topics will be voted on to decide the display of the content.
2. Users can also use the subscription model to subscribe to their favorite authors.
3. Users can also find the content they need by using a search keyword or tag.

- Why flow
1. Candence, which allows NFT to have its own type of resources.
2. Flow is a layer of the public chain for mainstream consumers, its GAS fee is low and can withstand a large influx of mainstream consumers. 
3. It is also environmentally friendly and consumes very little energy
This coincides with the idea of our product ---- We not only want to attract native WEB3 users, but we also want to lower the threshold to bring more consumers into the WEB3 world, and hope to redefine the content creation and consumption model together with everyone. All these determine that the Flow chain is the best choice for us.

Create-fi
- Content
The entire SALIGIA platform will have 7 content divisions corresponding to the seven sins.
Gula corresponds to food, store exploration, recipes and other contents. The Pride community, encourages the exchange and sharing of personal strengths and different cultures. The greed community where financial knowledge and cryptocurrency news are delivered. In the slothcommunity, users can share goodies such as DAPP or other products and methods that make our lives easier. In the envy community, users can release their anxiety, insecurities and dreams. In the lust community, we can see all the beautiful content such as makeup, dressing and dancing. In the wrath community, we focus on minority groups, remote areas, women's and children's rights, and other issues that we care about.
At the same time, there will be a separate space for women in the app, which will be curated and governed by female community members.

- NFT
Sin NFT
- Digital Identity
Users can write their SIN STORY on NFT. The value of NFT is no longer limited to rarity, and users' creativity will give it more value.
- Community Membership
Users will participate in community governance as a member of SALIGIA DAO. The governance includes: product feature proposal and voting, managing partition, holding theme creation activities, voting and curation of theme content, etc. And community members will also get a share of community revenue.

- Platform Membership
With SIN series NFT, you will enjoy SALIGIA membership benefits, including: unlocking exclusive community content, longer reading time, greater creative rights, more tokens with the same amount of activity, and the right to purchase paid content at a discount.

- Magic Pen NFT
Magic Pen NFT is included in the SIN Series NFT, which is used to create and consume content on the platform to earn tokens.
(Note:Users without SIN series will receive pen NFT airdrop upon registration)

Each magic pen has the following basic attributes
1. Ink ---- grows automatically every two hours, and the ink pool will no longer grow after it is full. 
$$Ink=10\times log_{10}(level+1)
$$
Posting content and browsing content will consume ink
2. Inspiration ---- the higher the inspiration value, the greater the probability of interaction to obtain the badge
3. Prestige ---- the higher the prestige, the greater the gain when getting article likes and favorites
4. Smoothness --- the higher the smoothness, the slower the durability decline
$$\cfrac{dD}{dS}=-\cfrac{100}{S}
$$
5. Durability ---- decreases every time you publish an article and interact . Once it drops to 0, it no longer generates revenue
6. Level ---- level increases, ink capacity and revenue efficiency increases

Next we will state how to build Create-Fi from several aspects: content creators, content consumers and advertisers.
Creator
Users can choose the partition for content creation. Each first creation of the day will be rewarded with SIN tokens. Earnings from published content are determined by the quality of the content (number of likes, collects).
$$Quality=Collect^{1.5}+like^{1.2}
$$
$$Income=Q×P×D×level
$$
We assume that the coefficients are all in[0,1]
Ink is consumed for creation and the pen will be depleted. The maximum amount of ink storage is determined by the account level.
The best content voted by the community will receive HUMAN tokens and theme badges.
HUMAN will be used as a community governance token and will be distributed in limited quantities.
Reader
Users will be rewarded with SIN tokens for completing the day's interactive tasks.
When users read content and interact with it by using collect, comments and favorites, they consume ink and the durability of the pen decreases.
Users have a certain chance of earning partition badges when interacting.
Seven different zone badges can be exchanged for HUMAN coins, and the women's zone badge can be used in place of any zone badge in the synthesis.


Advertiser
Advertisers need to buy ad space to place ads. The revenue earned through advertising will be partially used to reward community members and partially used to support the development of the platform. Advertisers can also choose to collaborate with creators or platforms through the platform to co-create content or hold events.
