          We build a relationship of trust between the donor and the vulnerable groups, providing a channel for interactive philanthropy between these two, thus making the act of charity visual and transparent.  We want to bring donations and attention to the recipient, second creation possibilities to the artist and interactive NFT play and mechanisms to all users.

          Our vision is to make Irisation a reliable NFT platform for charitable purposes. Using the features of NFT and blockchain to build a trusting relationship between donor and recipient. We will definitely provide a one-stop marketplace for visualisation and transparency of charitable acts.
          Our mission at this stage is to become the most humane and charitable NFT platform in the world. Through Irisation, recipients raise money by minting NFTs and donors buy them to pass on their care, while also gaining the right to recreate them, thus making NFT business practices human and warm.

          HOW IT WORKS
        </h1>
        <div>
          <h1 className='b_2'>
            Although there are various charities on the market today, various incidents have led to a deep crisis of trust and fraudulent donations have hindered the expansion of charities.

        <div>
          <h3 className='para_3'>
           Through the NFT, people from all walks of life will participate in charity and spread the value of transparency given by the blockchain to the whole society. The fragmentable NFT is a physical demonstration of the principle that "helping people is a small thing, and good deeds are done from the heart".
