Irisation is an NFT platform dedicated to supporting humanitarian charities and VGs. We build a relationship of trust between the donor and the vulnerable groups, providing a channel for interactive philanthropy between these two, thus making the act of charity visual and transparent.  We want to bring donations and attention to the recipient, second creation possibilities to the artist and interactive NFT play and mechanisms to all users.


Our first user, a group of people who see the world differently from many others. This is a unique gift given to them by God and should not be a barrier to life. Perhaps their lives are not all black but they already have a line drawing and they need our help to fill it with colour. Designer Wu Di has produced an artistic avatar, NFT, in black and white but with chaotic lines, lines that are chaotic but reveal resilience. Even though the heavens have covered children with colour and light, it is their minds that are their vision and should be valued by society.

In order to allow the NFT to continue spreading revenue, the NFT, which has been secondarily created, will create a linked GIF effect with the original NFT. the NFT will be sold on the open market while also allowing more people to see the charitable story and humanitarian values it represents behind the scenes. A percentage of the transaction fees from trading on the open market will also go back to the recipient's address, a percentage that will be determined by the subsequent user, opening up the proceeds and the willingness to donate to each trader.


The designer represents the child by fragmenting the copyright into a second-created licensed NFT, at which point the donor donates to the child by purchasing the fragmented NFT and obtaining the second-created license, so that they can bring colour to the original NFT and to the child. 
On the other hand, through the NFT royalty-related interface, it is ensured that every transaction down the line will have a corresponding percentage of the return revenue, guaranteeing the power and profitability of the Second Creation users and artists. 

In short, the use of NFT fragmentation, di-creation and overlay technology to solve market pain points and allow for transparency in charitable activities. Also coupled with smart contract provisions that allow the platform to flow back around 1.5% + 1% for the donor + 1% to 2% for the artist + self-regulation by the trader, all parties are able to benefit from this either spiritually or capital-wise.

For our part, our team hopes to use Flow's NFT application layer and visibility to quickly deliver charity to a wide range of people, both ordinary people and big capitalists, for a change to help promote and popularise Flow. IRIS-NFT, on the other hand, hopes to use visual impairment as an entry point to focus on more special people, providing innovative and viable solutions for charity and making the broken circle sustainable.
