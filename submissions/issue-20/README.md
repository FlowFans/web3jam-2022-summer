# Project Name
### Focus

## Track

- [ ] NFT x DAO/Tools
- [x] NFT x Game/Entertainment
- [x] NFT x Life/Metaverse

## Description

Nowadays, people use the mobile Internet for too long and cannot concentrate on more valuable things, such as study, work, and family accompaniment. We aim to develop a Dapp on Flow called Focus that can help everyone develop good habits of concentration and improve life efficiency. At the same time, I hope everyone can put down their mobile phones and bring life back to reality and reduce the use of time-wasting mobile applications through Focus to allow everyone to participate in the realization of carbon neutrality. We aim to integrate web3.0 and NFT into a green and healthy life through the Focus application. Focus attempts to encourage more people to participate in the green and healthy life model of web3.0.

### Problem statement


<!--
Please describe the following

-->
- Target audience 
  Focus's target audience is mainly Web2.0 and Web3.0 users who focus on time management, focus on habits, and focus on green and low carbon.
  
- Evidence for the need
  It is becoming more and more difficult for people to concentrate on doing things in the process of using mobile phones. We hope that through Web3.0 application products, users will be motivated to develop the habit of concentration and participate in carbon neutral actions.

### Proposed solution

<!--
Please describe the following, including but not limited to:

- Product Introduction
- Product Logo (Optional)
- Technical architecture
- Operational strategy
-->
- Product Introduction: Focus Dapp regulates the time people use their mobile phones and help people develop a healthy life habit. Focus motivates people by encouraging them to cultivate NFT trees, and participate in "Focus" mode. Dedicated time helps reduce carbon emissions and contributes to global environmental protection. The green and healthy features of Focus bring users a high-quality product experience.

- NFT Trees: Focus Dapp will provide several NFT trees of different qualities, which users can freely buy and sell in the built-in market. Trees of different qualities have different initial properties. Each tree has specific levels and four types of properties: Time, revenue, life decay, and carbon reduction capability. Different properties determine the upgrade processes of the trees. After reaching the L10 level, two NFT trees can be minted to get a new tree. The mint process generates a new tree according to a designed algorithm. The tree at level L10 has a certain lifespan, and when the lifespan is reached, the NFT tree will be destroyed automatically. 
  
- Focus to Earn: Users can enter the Focus Dapp and purchase NFT trees in the market. If the tree level is lower than L10, it needs to be upgraded by focusing. After the level reaches L10, the focusing task can be completed at a fixed time every day, and users can earn platform revenue.
  
- Token Economics: The platform obtains the tax of the NFT tree mint and the tax of the NFT tree transaction. Both mint and transaction will be required to pay Flow token. Users earn income through NFT trees that reach L10 level, and the attributes of different NFT trees will increase the income. The platform incentivizes users a certain percentage of the tax every day, and the flow of incentives is not less than 40% of the tax. The daily earnings obtained by users through Focus will be settled to the Focus Dapp Wallet.
  
- Carbon Neutral: The user reduces the use of the mobile phone applications and saves battery power every time the user focuses. This behavior has the effect of carbon reduction and helps protect the environment. And the Focus Dapp will calculate the user's real-time carbon reduction and present it on the app.
  
- Technical architecture: The bottom layer of the platform is implemented based on the Flow blockchain, and integrates Blocto as the built-in Wallet to meet the rapid recording and circulation of platform assets. The middle layer realizes the function of NFT through a non-fungible token contract, and realizes the incentive settlement function through smart contracts. The application layer realizes the interaction with the underlying blockchain and the functional logic through the Android/ios terminal Dapp.
  
- Operational strategy: Focus is built for Web2.0 and Web3.0 users, especifically those who focus on time management and want to live a green and low-carbon life. The platform will continue to serve users with good product functions and experience, focus on product practicability, and provide users with high-quality product services. Besides, Focus Dapp encourages users to participate in the "Focus mode" through high-revenue token economics.
